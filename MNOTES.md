## MALWARE ANALYSIS TOOLS

#### <ins> Basic Static Analysis Tools:</ins>

- **md5deep** - calculate file hash
- **[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)** - upload .exe file / input .exe's md5 hash
- **strings** - prints ascii and unicode chars from raw .exe
- **PEiD | Exeinfo PE** - detect type of packer if used in .exe
- **upx** - to unpack a packed .exe with upx
- **[Dependency Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com)** - explore dynamically linked functions to an .exe
- **PEview** | **PE Explorer** - browse through PE file format in an .exe
- **[PEBrowse Professional](http://www.smidgeonsoft.prohosting.com/pebrowse-pro-file-viewer.html)** - allows to look bytes from each section and shows the parsed data from PE
- **[Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/)** - shows all the resources used by an .exe

- **Sandboxes** - a security mechanism for running untrusted programs in a safe environment
  - **Norman SandBox**
  - **GFI Sandbox** (formerly **CWSandbox**)
  - **Anubis**
  - **Joe Sandbox**
  - **ThreatExpert**
  - **BitBlaze**
  - **Comodo Instant Malware Analysis**

- **rundll32.exe** - provides a container for running a DLL
  > <ins>Syntax:</ins>
  >```bat
  >C:\> rundll32.exe DLLname, Export arguments
  >```
  > <ins>Example 1:</ins>
  >```bat
  > C:\> rundll32.exe rip.dll, Install
  >```
  > <ins>Example 2: (**Using ordinal number**)</ins>  
  >```bat
  > C:\> rundll32.exe xyzzy.dll, #5
  >```
  > <ins>Example 3: (**Install DLL with an export as a service, & starting the service**)</ins>  
  >```bat
  > C:\> rundll32.exe ipr32x.dll, InstallService ServiceName
  > C:\> net start ServiceName
  >```

- **Process Monitor / procmon** - provides way to monitor registry, file system, network, process, thread activity, registries and has advanced filtering in basis of windows apis, processes, thread, operation, filter inclusion exclusion etc (Later could be saved and used in **ProcDOT** to see changes visually)

- **Process Explorer / procexp** - an overkill version of Windows Task Manager that allows to view each process's threads, handles, strings in disk and in memory, dlls loaded, tcp/ip connections established or listening to, activity monitoring such as disk, network, memory, cpu

- **Regshot** - take and compare two registry snapshots before and after executing an .exe

- **[ApateDNS](https://fireeye.market/apps/211380)** - view DNS requests created from an .exe by spoofing DNS responses and listens in UDP 53

- **Netcat / nc** - used for in/outbound connections for port scanning, listening/connecting to servers, tunneling, proxying, port forwarding etc
  > <ins>Example: (**Listen for connections in port 80**)</ins>
  >```bat
  >C:\> nc -l -p 80
  >```

- **Wireshark** - packet capture tool that intercepts and logs network traffic, provides visualization, packet-stream/in-depth analysis of individual packets, analyze internal networks, view network usage, debug app issues, reverse-engineer network protocols, steal sensitive information etc

- **INetSim** - software suite used for simulating common Internet services to identify network behavior of unknown malware samples
